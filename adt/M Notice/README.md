M-Notice Board
===========

In almost every institution, notices are put on notice-boards. These notices are traditionally printed 
on paper. The concerned person (user) would go the notice board and go through the notices that 
interest him/her.

However, as the number of notices increase it becomes a tedious job for the user to keep track of all 
the notices and in the process the user may miss some of the notices. Also traditionally the notice 
boards become a crowded place making it even hard to access the notices, especially for the female 
and physically handicapped. If the information in the notice is not stored, the user is bound to lose 
the notice. Another concern is that the not all of the user have access to an internet connection to 
fetch the required information from the website of concerned institution. 

The growth of smartphone users has been phenomenal. The use of these smartphones as a tool 
should be in position to provide access to the notices at the userâ€™s fingertips thereby enabling 
him/her to manage the notices effectively. The smartphone would establish a wireless connection to 
the notice board and fetch notices without any internet connection.
